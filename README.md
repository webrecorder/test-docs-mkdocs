# MkDocs test repo

## First impressions

Really simple to setup and configure! Loving the easy auto-reloading dev server too for checking out changes on the fly. Seems like what you get out of the box is relatively bare bones but can be extended with various plugins and Markdown extensions.

Overall very positive first impression.

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
